which is an extension of [DSBI](https://github.com/yeluo1994/DSBI) and [AngelinaDataset](https://github.com/IlyaOvodov/AngelinaDataset).

The dataset will be used for creation of a Braille characters detector based on the [AngelinaReader](https://github.com/IlyaOvodov/AngelinaReader).
The current version of the detector is here: [zuevval/AngelinaReader](https://github.com/zuevval/AngelinaReader)
